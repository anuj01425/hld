Ways to map the keys to host

    1. Range based : Map the value range of keys to host. e.g if keys will be in range 1-100, map it to host 1. Prone to
       hotspots.
    2. Hash based. Good hash function can map the keys to host. server = hash(key)%(number of host). Problem being if
       the number of host changes, lot of the keys will be remapped.
    3. Consistent Hashing : This is the most popular way of mapping the keys to host. Limitation of hash based approach comes
       from modulo. If we can somehow eliminate the modulo, we can make the keys mapping independent on number of host.
       We can take the hash function as sha256 which will always give the value from 0 to 2^256-1.
       If we have to map the keys, we need to find the next greatest sha256(host) which is present. If no such host are
       there, it can be mapped to the first host. Image this as the circular ring.
